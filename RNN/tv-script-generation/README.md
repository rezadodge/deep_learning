# <span style="color:darkred"> Generating TV Scripts using Recurrent Neural Network </span>

In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is built and trained to generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern) from [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons). A part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons is used for training. 

### <span style="color:darkred"> The generated script </span>
Part the script is meaningless, but to be fair to our RNN we should not expect everything said by Homer and his drinking buddies at 
Moe's Tavern to have meaning:) Still the RNN has done a good job as it has trained only on less than a megabyte of text. This was done 
so that training the network would not take a very long time! Here is the generated script.

    homer_simpson:(confused) hey, what's going on? that guy's fat tony.
    homer_simpson: why don't you come too?
    moe_szyslak:(serious, homer) ah, you little yellow-belly. what's the big person.
    moe_szyslak: oh, that's it... uh, that's just...
    moe_szyslak:(sighs) so you all hate me?
    moe_szyslak:(nods) okay, i got.
    carl_carlson: oh, i'm afraid lenny's dead.
    moe_szyslak:(friendly) really?
    homer_simpson:(murderously) i am the guys!

    barney_gumble:(to moe, in) hey, the? is that says big, uh... uh... oh, nuts. they're both friends.
    moe_szyslak: nope, homer.
    homer_simpson:(inanely) whoa, what's the best...
    chief_wiggum:(motorcycle noises) yeah, moe, i've been seen barney.
    moe_szyslak:(excited) i am so about this, moe.
    moe_szyslak:(struggling shotgun) i knew the booze.
    moe_szyslak:(under it, then clearly) the booze! and feeling...
    moe_szyslak:(excited) or i wouldn't.

    moe_szyslak:(to patrons) i won't tell if you and, your friend... swings to have about that.
    barney_gumble:(annoyed) you do it?!
    homer_simpson:(sings) i know, that's it. the costume's buried on the pickle.
    moe_szyslak: yeah, i did it was either cable the mechanical.
    moe_szyslak: you got to this friend!
